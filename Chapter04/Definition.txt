Association is a relationship between two separate classes through objects.
 It represents "has-a" relationship.
 Both classes are independent.
 One class uses another class.
Or,
Association means one class contains a reference of another class.

Real Life Example:-
A Student studies in a College
Student can exist without College (object-wise)
College can exist without Student
So this is Association.
