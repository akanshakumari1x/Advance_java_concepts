Association is a relationship between two separate classes through objects.
 It represents "has-a" relationship.
 Both classes are independent.
 One class uses another class.
Or,
Association means one class contains a reference of another class.

Real Life Example:-
A Student studies in a College
Student can exist without College (object-wise)
College can exist without Student
So this is Association.

Types of Association.

There are mainly 2 types:-
1. Aggregation (Weak Association)
Relationship is weak.
Objects can exist independently.
Ex- Employee → Department
If department is deleted, employee can still exist.


2.Composition (Strong Association)
Strong relationship.
If parent object is destroyed, child is also destroyed.
Ex- House → Room
If house is destroyed, rooms are also destroyed.
