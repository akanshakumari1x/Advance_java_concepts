What Are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.
They are not ready-made code, but templates or blueprints that help you write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

Why Do We Need Design Patterns?
When building applications (like your Spring Boot projects), problems repeat:
How to create objects properly?
How to reduce tight coupling?
How to manage dependencies?
How to make code flexible?
Design patterns help solve these systematically.

Types of Design Patterns:-
Design patterns are mainly divided into 3 categories:

1.Creational Patterns (Object Creation)
2.Structural Patterns (Class/Object Structure)
3.Behavioral Patterns (Object Communication)

1.Creational Patterns (Object Creation) :- 
These deal with how objects are created.

Pattern  	 -  Purpose
Singleton	 -  Only one object instance
Factory	         -  Create object without exposing creation logic
Abstract Factory  - Factory of factories
Builder	          - Build complex objects step-by-step
Prototype	-   Clone existing object.

Example: Singleton Pattern.
Used when only one instance should exist.
