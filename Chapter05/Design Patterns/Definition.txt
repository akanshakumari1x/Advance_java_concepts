What Are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.
They are not ready-made code, but templates or blueprints that help you write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

Why Do We Need Design Patterns?
When building applications (like your Spring Boot projects), problems repeat:
How to create objects properly?
How to reduce tight coupling?
How to manage dependencies?
How to make code flexible?
Design patterns help solve these systematically.

Types of Design Patterns:-
Design patterns are mainly divided into 3 categories:

1.Creational Patterns (Object Creation)
2.Structural Patterns (Class/Object Structure)
3.Behavioral Patterns (Object Communication)

1.Creational Patterns (Object Creation) :- 
These deal with how objects are created.

Pattern  	 -  Purpose
Singleton	 -  Only one object instance
Factory	         -  Create object without exposing creation logic
Abstract Factory  - Factory of factories
Builder	          - Build complex objects step-by-step
Prototype	-   Clone existing object.

1. Singleton Pattern.
Only one instance of a class exists in the entire application.

2.Factory Pattern.

The Factory Design Pattern is a Creational Pattern used to create objects without exposing the object creation logic to the client.
Instead of using new directly, we delegate object creation to a factory class
Example - Payment System (Good for Your Banking Project).

Why Do We Need Factory?

Payment payment = new CreditCardPayment();
If tomorrow you change to UPI, you must modify the code everywhere.
This creates tight coupling. Factory pattern solves this.

The Spring Framework internally uses Factory pattern:
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
Spring uses BeanFactory internally to create objects.
you never write:- new UserService();    Spring creates it for you.
