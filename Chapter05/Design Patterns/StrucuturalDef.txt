Structural Design Patterns (Structure of Classes):-

Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are organized and connected to form larger structures.
They help you: Reduce tight coupling, Improve flexibility, Reuse existing code, Integrate different systems.

Types of Structural Patterns:-
Pattern	    -  Purpose
Adapter	       Connect incompatible interfaces
Decorator	Add behavior dynamically
Proxy	        Control access
Facade	        Simplify complex system
Composite	Tree structure
Bridge	      Separate abstraction & implementation

1. Adapter Pattern:-
The Adapter Pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.It acts like a bridge between two systems. or “Adapter pattern converts the interface of one class into another interface that the client expects.”
Real life ex:- Mobile Charger.

Example;-
Imagine your banking system supports a new payment API.
your system expects: 

public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount); }

But third-party API gives:

public class ThirdPartyPayment {
    public void makePayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Payment done via Third Party API: " + amount);
    }  }
 Problem: Method names are different → incompatible interfaces.
