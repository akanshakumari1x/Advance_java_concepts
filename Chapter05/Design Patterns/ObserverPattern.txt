Behavioral Design Patterns:-

Behavioral patterns focus on how objects communicate with each other.
They define: How objects interact, How responsibility is distributed, How communication is handled.

One of the most important behavioral patterns is:
What is Observer Pattern?
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects.
When one object changes state, All its dependent objects (observers) are notified automatically.
Or,
"Observer pattern allows multiple objects to listen to changes in another object and get notified automatically."

Real-Life Example:-
YouTube Channel
You subscribe to a channel.
When a new video is uploaded,
All subscribers receive notification.

Here:
Channel = Subject, Subscribers = Observers

Real Example in Spring
The Spring Framework uses Observer pattern in:
Application Events

@EventListener
public void handleEvent(CustomEvent event) {
    // react to event
}
Spring internally uses:
Publisher (Subject)
EventListener (Observer)

Real Example in Your Banking System:-
When a transaction happens:
 Send Email, Send SMS, Update Audit Log, Notify Admin

Instead of calling all manually, use Observer pattern.
Transaction = Subject
EmailService, SMSService, AuditService = Observers


When To Use Observer Pattern?
Use when:
1. Multiple objects depend on one object
2. You need automatic notification
3. You want loose coupling
4. Event-driven systems

Avoid when:
1. Too many observers (performance issue)
2. Complex dependency chains
