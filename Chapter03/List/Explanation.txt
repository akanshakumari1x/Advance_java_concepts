ArrayList is backed by a dynamic array and provides fast random access, while LinkedList uses a doubly linked list and provides faster insertions and deletions but slower access.

ArrayList Example:-
Think of ArrayList like a dynamic array.
Best when you read data more than modifying.
Example Scenario
You are showing a list of products on a website.

LinkedList Example:-
Think of LinkedList like train coaches 
Each coach connected to next.
Best when you add/remove frequently


| Feature              | ArrayList     | LinkedList         |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Data Structure       | Dynamic array | Doubly linked list |
| Memory               | Continuous    | Nodes + pointers   |
| Access time          | Fast (O(1))   | Slow (O(n))        |
| Insert/Delete middle | Slow          | Fast               |
| Memory usage         | Less          | More               |
