What is the Collection Framework?



The Java Collection Framework (JCF) is a set of classes and interfaces used to store and manipulate groups of objects.It helps you manage multiple objects as a single unit (like a container).

Or,

The Java Collection Framework is a unified architecture of interfaces, classes, and algorithms that provides ready-made data structures like List, Set, Queue, and Map to store and manipulate groups of objects dynamically and efficiently.



Important Features of Collection Framework:-

Dynamic resizing

Data structure ready-made

Generics support

Thread-safe options (Vector, Hashtable)

Sorting and searching support

Performance optimized



1\. List (Ordered, Allows duplicates)

Think: shopping list- Maintains insertion order, Index based access, Duplicates allowed.

Classes:- ArrayList \& LinkedList.



2\. Set (No duplicates)

Think: roll numbers of students- No duplicate values, Order may or may not be maintained

Classes:- HashSet - Fast, no order, LinkedHashSet - Maintains insertion order, TreeSet -Sorted order.



3\. Queue (FIFO)

Think: people in a queue - First In First Out.



4\. Map (Key-Value Pair)

Not a child of Collection, but part of framework.

Think: Dictionary- Keys are unique, Values can repeat
